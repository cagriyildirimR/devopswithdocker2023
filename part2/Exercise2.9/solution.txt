In the previous exercise, we assigned the value of our backend URL to the environment variable REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL and the value of our frontend URL to the variable REQUEST_ORIGIN.

However, we now need to make some changes because we are using a proxy to facilitate communication between services and serve as the entry point for our application.

To make these changes, please follow the steps below:

1. Remove the line that sets the value of REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL from the Dockerfile.frontend file.
2. In the docker-compose.yml file, add the following line to the environment section: REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://proxy:80.
3. Remove the line that sets the value of REQUEST_ORIGIN from the Dockerfile.backend file.
4. In the docker-compose.yml file, add the following line to the environment section: REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://proxy:80.

Once these changes are made, all buttons in the application should work properly.
