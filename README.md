# DevOps with Docker Course Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises for the [DevOps with Docker course](https://devopswithdocker.com). The course covers fundamental Docker concepts, Docker Compose, and security and optimization in Docker. The aim of this course is to teach students how to work with Docker and use it to simplify the development process, manage complex multi-container applications, and optimize Docker images for production.

## Repository structure

Each part has its own folder and exercise files are named Exercise X.Y, where X is the part number and Y is the exercise number.

The repository follows this structure:

````
partX/
  ├── Exercise X.1
  ├── Exercise X.2
  ├── Exercise X.3
  ...
````
Each exercise file contains the relevant Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, or other required files, as well as a brief explanation of the solution.
