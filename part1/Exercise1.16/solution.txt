I used fly.io for deployment. After authenticating, 
I navigated to the folder where our Dockerfile is located. 
Then, I executed the command flyctl launch. This command 
prompted me to enter the name of the app and asked whether 
the app required a database or any other dependencies.

hostname: good-fortune.fly.dev
